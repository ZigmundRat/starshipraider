### Debugging / reworkability

* [x] Use 0-ohm resistors vs direct hard-wiring for strap pins when possible

## Thermal

* [x] Power estimates for all large / high power ICs
    * DCDC modules are within operating limits, so should be fine
    * RAM could be up to 8W instantaneous, likely not sustained
    * Big FPGA is ~11W dissipation
    * Small FPGA is barely going to get warm
    * STM32 is 1W
    * QSFP+ is 3W max
    * PLL is 2W
    * Everything else should be <1W per chip
* [x] Thermal calculations for all large / high power ICs
    * Not much we can do for RAM or DCDCs
    * FPGA is 11.7C/W so 129C rise with no heatsink!!
    * STM32 is 29C/W so max 29C rise, should be OK
    * No good data for QSFP+ but 3W over a fairly large area shoooould be ok? Not a dense array of them
    * PLL is 25.2C/W Ja, 6.9 Jc. 50W rise with no heatsink is borderline
* [x] Specify heatsinks as needed
    * FPGA needs heatsink for sure. Wakefield 658-60ABT3 is 2C/W @ 500LFM so total ~22C rise
    * Put one on PLL to be safe. Assmann V2016B should be good.
